# 1.x to 2.0 Migration Guide
## Namespace
SecureHeaders now has a namespace, so you should now use the line
```php
use Aidantwoods\SecureHeaders\SecureHeaders;
```
somewhere, or all the class via the full namespace location.

## Removed Methods
* `doneOnOutput` and `done` are now `applyOnOutput` and `apply`. These new
  methods allow custom HttpAdapters to be used (so you can integrate more
  easily with frameworks), but if you supply no arguements the "global"
  HttpAdaper will be used (i.e. interact directly with PHPs `header()` and
  similar functions).

* `addHeader` has been removed. You should add headers with `header()` or via
  your framework now.

* `correctHeaderName` has been removed. Please ensure your header names are
  correct
