## Description
```php
void done ( void )
```

`->done()` is used to move the list of headers configured in SecureHeaders, into PHPs internal list of headers.

Calling this function will initiate the following

1. Existing PHP headers will be imported into SecureHeaders' internal list, parsed, and then removed from PHPs list
2. [Automatic header functions](auto) will be applied
3. [CSP](csp), [HSTS](hsts), and [HPKP](hpkp) policies will be compiled and added to SecureHeaders' internal header list 
4. Headers queued for [removal](removeHeader) will be deleted from SecureHeaders' internal header list
5. [Safe Mode](safeMode) will examine the list of headers, and make any required changes according to its settings
6. Headers will be copied from SecureHeaders' internal header list, into PHPs (now empty) list of headers
7. If [error reporting](errorReporting) is enabled (both within SecureHeaders and according to the PHP configuration values for error reporting, and whether to display errors)
   * Missing security headers will be reported as `E_USER_WARNING`
   * Misconfigured headers will be reported as `E_USER_WARNING` or `E_USER_NOTICE` depending on severity, the former being most severe an issue.

**Note:** Calling this function is **required** before the first byte of output in order for SecureHeaders to (be able to) do anything. If you're not sure when the first byte of output might occur, or simply don't want to have to call this every time â€“ take a look at [`->doneOnOutput`](doneOnOutput) to have SecureHeaders take care of this for you.
